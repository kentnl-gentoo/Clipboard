SYNOPSIS
        use Clipboard;
        print Clipboard->paste;
        Clipboard->copy($foo);

        # Clipboard->cut() is an alias for copy(), but the less-preferred
        # name - you're not really "cutting", just copying.

DESCRIPTION
        The clipboard (or "selection", under some environments) is so
        useful.  If we get this working well, then it will also be trivial
        to use from your Perl code.

STATUS
        Very early.  Please help me get this running smoothly.
